# OMA&D Web Student Assistant...Assistant
This tool will make certain tasks easier/faster to do. My role as student assistant ended as of June 7th, 2018, so feel free to make a PR for any updates/features. 

## Gallery Post
Make sure the images of a gallery post are uploaded in the order in which Erin specified. I find that uploading the images one-by-one is better since uploading all the images at once results in a different order. This tool will simply increase the photo ID by 1 from the start value to end value for you. Grab the photo ID of the first image and last image uploaded for the gallery post and enter them into the form. You will be given the appropriate shortcode to implement a gallery post. You can find the photo ID in the URL or **Permalink** below the image title when viewing the image in the Media tab of the WordPress Admin Panel.

The photo ID in the image below would be 30083

## Sidebar Post
Provide the article title, link, date, and a thumbnail image, and the form will provide you the HTML code to place into the pagelet.
